\subsubsection {Overview}

The code for a sample load program is given on page 117-129 of the TPC-C document. It defines the global variables, loads the tables (WAREHOUSE, DISTRICT, CUSTOMER, ORDER-LINE etc.), generates data for them according to the guidelines, and handles errors.

Worth noting are some contants and global variables used in some transactions above:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The maximum number of items: MAXITEMS = 100000
    \item Customers per district: CUST\_PER\_DIST = 3000
    \item Districts per warehouse: DIST\_PER\_WARE = 10
    \item Orders per districts: ORD\_PER\_DIST = 3000 
\end{itemize}
