\subsubsection{The Transaction Profile}

For a given warehouse number (w\_id), district number (d\_id), and stock level threshold (threshold):

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The row in the DISTRICT (D) table with matching D.wId and D.dId is selected and D.nextOrdId is retrieved.
    
    \item All rows in the ORDER-LINE (OL) table with matching OL.wId (equals w\_id), OL.dId (equals d\_id), and OL.oId (lower than D.nextOrdId and greater than or equal to D.nextOrdId - 20) are selected. They are the items for 20 recent orders of the district.
    
    \item All rows in the STOCK (S) table with matching S.iId (equals OL.iId) and S.wId (equals w\_id) from the list of distinct item numbers and with S.quantity lower than threshold are counted (giving low\_stock).
\end{enumerate}
